# Classifeyer

Classifeyer is an image classifying application, that uses a nearest-neighbor regression model with TensorFlow.js. Accounts can also be created using Google Oauth. The classifeye app is defaulted on "Person", "Dog", and "Giraffe", but can be changed by a user, without harm to the model, as it is not pre-trained. Currently the model uses 20 snapshots taken every 1 second to make its prediction.
